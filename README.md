# Clustering-Algorithms
Evaluation of 3 different Clustering Algorithms on different data distributions.
Implemented algorithms:

* K-Means
* DBSCAN
* Agglomerative Clustering

Distributions:

* Blobs
* Moons
* Circles

Among these models, DBSACN worked best on all three generated distributions by not only identifying the clusters, but also detecting the outliers.
